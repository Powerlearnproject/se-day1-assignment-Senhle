Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a process of writting/creating computer software. It includes designing apps and systems, writing code,testing and fixing , and maintaining those software.
Importance of Software Engineer


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. It was first introduced in 1968- Expert met and introduced the term software engineering and they discussed ways to design and build software.
2. 1970s-1980s-Development of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages.
3. 1990s: Introduction of Agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. It typically involves phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:Is best with projects with clear, unchanging requirements.
Examples:
Banking Software
hospital Management System
Manufacturing projects
Agile:Is best for projects with changing requirments.
Examples:
Mobile apps
Screaming services(Netflix,YouTube)
Online Stores

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer write the actual code that make the software work.
QA engineers create test plans, manual tests, automated tests using tools and frameworks to make sure that software  run as expected.
Project Manager  coordinates the elements of a project, aiming for timely completion within budget and with high standards.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments:They help programmers write code easily and quickly, without the problem of having to manually compile or run applications(e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse).
Version control lets save different version of code ,track file changes and access specific versions when needed(e.g., Git, GitHub).
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is to verify that each unit of the software working as it should be.
Integration testing is the process of testing how different units of code work together as a whole.
System testing is the process of testing the entire software system as a single entity. 
Acceptance testing is the process of testing the software by the end users or customers to confirm that it meets their requirements and expectations

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs (prompts) to AI models to elicit desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Power Learninf Project.
Improved Prompht:
Explain what Power Project is, what it aims to do, and how it is helping improve education in africa?
